Hi! Welcome to our game of pool! The rules are the same as normal pool.
To rotate the cue, use the left and right arrows.
To adjust the power of your hit, use the up and down arrows.
To shoot, press the space bar.
If you get all the colored balls in the pockets, followed by the black 8 ball, you win!
Remember, if you get the 8 ball in before the rest of them, you lose.
If the cue ball falls in a pocket, it will reset itself to the original position.
To skip to the end of the game, press the q key.
Have fun!
